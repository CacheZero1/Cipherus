<h1>Hey Cipherus Users! üëã</h1>
I‚Äôve got some updates about Cipherus. First off, I just want to say a huge thanks to everyone who‚Äôs tried out the project. I know Cipherus isn‚Äôt perfect‚ÄîI‚Äôm just an amateur dev figuring things out as I go‚Äîbut it‚Äôs been amazing to see people use something I‚Äôve worked on. ‚ù§Ô∏è<br />
That said, Cipherus will soon won't be updated here anymore. In fact, soon, my GitHub account will be deleted (due to privacy concerns). Instead, I‚Äôm moving Cipherus, including all my other projects, to CodeBerg. I‚Äôll keep improving Cipherus there, along with all of my future project.<br />
Additionally, all future releases will bring more content and changes, as to not be a nuisance to the CodeBerg Team. <br />
[My account is already active](https://codeberg.org/CacheZero1) <br />
Thanks again for all your support‚Äîit means a lot to me as a solo dev just trying to create something useful.<br />
Stay tuned, and feel free to reach out with any questions or feedback on the issues tab!
