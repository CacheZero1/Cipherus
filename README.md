<h1>Hey Cipherus Users! üëã</h1>
I‚Äôve got some updates about Cipherus. First off, I just want to say a huge thanks to everyone who‚Äôs tried out the project. I know Cipherus isn‚Äôt perfect‚ÄîI‚Äôm just an amateur dev figuring things out as I go‚Äîbut it‚Äôs been amazing to see people use something I‚Äôve worked on. ‚ù§Ô∏è<br />
That said, Cipherus will soon get its final update here on GitHub. After that, it won‚Äôt be updated or maintained on this platform anymore. Instead, I‚Äôm moving it to a new website I‚Äôm building. It‚Äôs nothing fancy (yet!), but it‚Äôll be the new home for Cipherus, and I‚Äôll keep improving it there, along with all of my future project.<br />
I‚Äôll share more details about the site once it‚Äôs ready (might take about a year though...), so you can follow along if you‚Äôre still interested. Thanks again for all your support‚Äîit means a lot to me as a solo dev just trying to create something useful.<br />
Stay tuned, and feel free to reach out with any questions or feedback on the issues tab!
